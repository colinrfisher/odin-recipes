# odin-recipes
A recipe website.

Goals:

    - To create a website that hosts (4) cocktail recipes inspired by car culture.
    - Utilize the classic BMW colorway for the site design when CSS is introduced.
    - Have the Dos Equis guy on the homepage.
    - Structure content to easily be styled with CSS in future iterations.

Edit 12/17/22
    - Changed styling to use an image background and white/gray colorway for simplicity for now.
    - Removed Mr. Dos Equis. 
    - Need to fix text resizing to fit containers when hovering over links on homepage.
